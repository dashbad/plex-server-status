I AM NO LONGER MAINTAINING THIS FORK


This is copied from Ryan Christensen's original project for his OSX server: https://bitbucket.org/ryanchristensen/d4rk.co

I have made a  number of changes:
- Modification of functions to support Linux shell commands
- Removed minecraft functionality
- Removed functionality specific to Ryan's setup (Hard disk names etc) and added my own
- Removed services I don't have on my server and added one (Subsonic)
- Modified the plex token function to pull this automatically from myplex (this does slow down page loading a fair bit)
- Moved user credentials to a config.ini you can place outside of your web root. Just make sure it is correctly included in the relevant functions that require it
- Amended IP Addresses to reflect my LAN

You will need php 5.5.4 and I'm running it on Apache
